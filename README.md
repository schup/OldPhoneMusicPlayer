# Music Player 
MusicPlayer based on the excellent work in https://github.com/RetroMusicPlayer/RetroMusicPlayer to make use of old phones.

Mainly for my own use.

I wanted a player that uses NFC tokens/cards to play album music (e.g. audiobooks) on an old
Android phone with broken touch screen.
